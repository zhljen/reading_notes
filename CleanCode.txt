To be a better programmer.

Chapter 1
What's clean code?
- Runs all the tests;
- Contains no duplication;
- Expresses all the design ideas that are in the system;
- Minimizes the number of entities such as classes, methods, functions, and the like.

Chapter 2
Meaningful names
-The name of a variable, function, or class, should answer why it exists, what it does, and how it is used. If a name requires a comment, then the name does not reveal its intent.
- Avoid disinformation, have meaningful distinctions
- The name should be pronounceable, searchable, and no encoding
- No extra prefix to name member, separate interface and implementation
- Use cs domain names and don't be cute
