Structuring your project
http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/structure/
- Structure is key
 -- modules ( use import statement )
    keep name short, lowercases, avoid . ?
    the import modu will look for the proper file, which is modu.py in the same directory as the caller. if not found, python interpreter will search in the "path" recursvely
    very bad practice: from modu import * ; better: from modu import sqrt; best import modu, x = modu.sqrt
 -- packages ( any directory with an __init__.py )
    file modu.py in the directory pack/ is imported by import pack.modu. it will look for __init__.py in pack, execute all the statements, then looks for file named modu.py, execute all the top-level statement. Leaving the __init__.py empty is good.
    import very.deep.model as mod is good
