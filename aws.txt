AWS design pattern
- Introduction to AWS
  -- computing and networking
     elastic cloud compute(EC2) virtual machines
     Route 53 DNS provides local and global DNS look-ups
     virtual private cloud (VPC) isolated cloud networks provide interal networks
     elastic load balancers (ELB) automatically distributed traffic across EC2 instances
     auto scaling groups (ASG) provide a way to scale instances up and down on schedules or metrics gathered via cloudwatch from EC2 instances
  -- Database
     simpleDB is a highly scalable NoSQL db
     relational database service (RDS) is a scalable SQL db apart from mysql, oracle, postgresql, sql server
     elasticcache is an in-memory cache on top of redis or memcached
  -- storage and content delivery
     simple storage service (s3) a distributed storage network that crosses data center boundaries with built-in redundancy
     cloudfront is a cdn that distributed content based on latency or location
  -- Application services
     simple queue service ( sqs )
  -- deployment and management
     cloudformation is a service that allows the provisioning and updating of AWS resources through templates, usually JSON
  -- logging
     CloudWatch can monitor, display, and alert on instance metrics and logs

- Cloud computing service models
  AWS falls in (PaaS, platform as a service )

- Common problems encountered at AWS
  underlying hardware failures
  over-provisioning
  under-provisioning
  replication
  redundancy
  improving end user experience
  monitoring and log-gathering

- Basic patterns
  snapshot pattern
